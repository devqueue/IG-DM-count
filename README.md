# IG-DM-count

This is a bot to count instagram dms exchanged between two people. Here's how to use it  

1. Edit the `conf.py` file, Enter your username and password
2. Install the requirements.txt
3. Run the `scrollbot.py` using this command --> `python -i scrollbot.py` The -i flag is important as it is a temporary hot fix for a bug. Now once it clicks through all the buttons and redirects you to your inbox you will manually need to select an account whose dms you want to count. You will also see a promt that says `Press enter after selecting a user` hit enter and then hit enter again to start scrolling to the top
4. Once you reach the top of your dms you'll still have a repl to interact with
5. Copy paste the lines after the for loop in scrollbot one at a time in the repl to get a count
